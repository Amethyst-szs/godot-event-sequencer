## So many options!  
Featuring dozens of built-in Event Items, there is almost nothing you can't make in the sequence editor. Organized into many different categories, the plugin comes with lots of Event Items built-in! These categories include:
- General purpose tools like debug logging and embedding GDScript right into your sequence!
- Defining or fetching variables, nodes, autoloads, and more
- Setting properties on objects and nodes
- Calling methods on objects and nodes
- Adding loops, conditions, jumps, and other playback/flow controls
- Waiting for different events
- Your own customizable macros
- And best for last, plugins that can do anything!
